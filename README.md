# Clavvs Web Application

Clavvs is a web application designed to help users conveniently book appointments and enroll in a nail salon. It was created to assist my girlfriend in organizing her schedule and is now used on a daily basis.

Additionally, the admin has the ability to confirm or reject meetings and has access to the entire meeting history.
